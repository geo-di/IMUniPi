# IMUnipi

IMUnipi is a university project. This project wanted us to recreate IMDb with some differences. First of all, we had to create our own layout that shouldn't be the same as the original site. Also, instead of movies we rate video clips. A visitor of the site can access the collection of clips and watch the videos and their reviews. In order to have full access, a user has to be logged in. Then there is also the ability to request new uploads and rate video clips. Requests are managed by admins of the site.


## Programming Languages

We used ASP.NET Web Forms from the ASP.NET fraamework in Visual Studio 2019
